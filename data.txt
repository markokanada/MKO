Amikor a hatóságok csapdájába esve túlerővel kerülnek szembe, Ilmar szabadságát föladva menti meg a többieket. A csapat szétszóródik, de többségük mégis újra összefut Pannónia fővárosában, Aquincumban. Közben a szálak egyre kuszálódnak, és Marcus hűséges követői közt felüti fejét a kétely: a fiú valóban az Úr új, földi helytartója, vagy valami sokkal sötétebb hatalmat képvisel? Közeleg a végső összecsapás, melynek kimenetelétől függhet a világ sorsa. Ha Marcus beveti az Eredendő Igét, az bőségszaruként visszahozhat a földre minden elrejtett kincset, még a vasat is. Csakhogy a hatalom minden eddiginél rettenetesebb eszközének is bizonyulhat.

Irina isn't rich, not quite, but she does have an artificial memory that gives her perfect recall, and lets her act as a medium between her various employers and their AIs, which are complex to the point of opacity. It's a good gig, paying enough for the annual visits to the Mayo Clinic that keep her from ageing.Kern has no such access; he's one of the many refugees in the sprawling drone-built favelas on the city's periphery, where he lives like a monk, training relentlessly in martial arts, scraping by as a thief and an enforcer.

9781984820990;Thrawn: Treason (Star Wars);Fiction;NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Grand Admiral Thrawn faces the ultimate test of his loyalty to the Empire in this epic Star Wars novel from bestselling author Timothy Zahn. “If I were to serve the Empire, you would command my allegiance.” Such was the promise Grand Admiral Thrawn made to Emperor Palpatine at their first meeting. Since then, Thrawn has been one of the Empire’s most effective instruments, pursuing its enemies to the very edges of the known galaxy. But as keen a weapon as Thrawn has become, the Emperor dreams of something far more destructive. Now, as Thrawn’s TIE defender program is halted in favor of Director Krennic’s secret Death Star project, he realizes that the balance of power in the Empire is measured by more than just military acumen or tactical efficiency. Even the greatest intellect can hardly compete with the power to annihilate entire planets. As Thrawn works to secure his place in the Imperial hierarchy, his former protégé Eli Vanto returns with a dire warning about Thrawn’s homeworld. Thrawn’s mastery of strategy must guide him through an impossible choice: duty to the Chiss Ascendancy, or fealty to the Empire he has sworn to serve. Even if the right choice means committing treason. Praise for Thrawn: Treason “Another excellent addition to the new canon . . .

Still, Darth Karrid, commander of the fearsome Imperial battle cruiser Ascendant Spear, continues her relentless efforts to achieve total Sith domination of the galaxy.
